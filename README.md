## Overview

### The project

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size - desktop, tablet, and mobile alike.
- Scroll through the page and view all the projects listed on the respective section.
- Watch the vector icons change sizes and positions on click.

### My Process

I applied the basic Responsive Web Design practices, CSS Animations, and some DOM manipulation to bring life to a creative porfolio website.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript


### What I learned

I learned how to solidify my grid and flex positioning as well as how to shift my responsive navigation menu.

### Continued development

I will invest more time in JavaScript Project-related practice to understand the logic behind some JavaScript concepts applied here - including DOM Manipulation.
I will continue to play around with CSS animations for more interactive websites.
I will also further my understanding of using the root element and some flex concepts.
